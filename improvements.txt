IMPLEMENTATION:
- File saving:
    - format: csv (BUT responses to surveys are saved as strings -> problems accessing graphs names?) / json (TO TRY)
    - quotes in output files: check how they are saved (use single quotes instead of double?)
- Vertical resolutions -> change to >1000? Check with different devices (check that resize of canvas and positioning of stimuli works also when browser zoom is not 100%)
- Occasional problems (potential issue for scalability of experiment):
    - csv file formatting issues
    - "out of memory" when opening N1000 link, it crashes (the computer only has 500MB of free memory) -> do a check of available memory before starting?
    - "zero rt" issue -> only happened for one subject, but try to solve it (NOT STORING ANSWER UNTIL CANVAS IS SHOWN, or checking for zero rts when trial is completed)

-----------------

COMMENTS FROM PARTICIPANTS:
- N1000 -> slow generation of stimuli induces errors (Nawal);
- Anna and Nawal -> blurry instruction and task familiarization images (device specs: Anna (1960x1080), Nawal (1960x1080) ). Possibility of doing these phases already with the canvas, so that it adapts to the screen;
- Ben:
* had the feeling like the task was easier when the side of the graph with the clique was changing;
* strategy of not looking at the stimulus directly, he was intentionally seeing it blurry so that the regularities were more evident.
- Marlen:
* perceived the N1000 task as way easier than the N300 one
* conspiracists tend to better find visual associations (literature)

POSTER FEEDBACK:
- Tavoni --> how are the statistical and computational limits calculated? What do they mean?
- Acerbi --> we are talking about the gap in the title but we are not really addressing it
