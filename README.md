# HUPLACLIP - A statistical-to-computational gap for intuitive human inference 

The project consists in an implementation of the planted clique problem using the JSPsych library.
The primary aim is to characterize under which conditions humans typically succeed or fail at the task, and to compare that with the predictions of the theory where the problem originated and was studied.
This project involves both SISSA and ICTP.

This folder contains:
- the basic structure of the experiment for N=1000;
- the scripts to generate the images used in tutorial and familiarization phases;
- the scripts to generate the graph pools for the various experiments;
- a backup of the graph pools used in all experiments.
