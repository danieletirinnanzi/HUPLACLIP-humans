# HUPLACLIP-humans

This repository contians a JSPsych implementation of the **Planted Clique Problem**, a theoretical computer science task focused on detecting hidden cliques within graphs. The primary aim is to characterize under which conditions humans typically succeed or fail at the task, and to compare that with the predictions of the theory where the problem originated and was studied.
This project involves both SISSA and ICTP. 

## Repository Structure

- **`canvas_drawing.js`**: Functions to draw the stimuli on the canvas.
- **`device_requirements.js`**: Lists device requirements for subjects' laptops.
- **`experiment_parameters.js`**: Parameters for the experiment.
- **`graphs_functions.js`**: Functions to generate the graphs.
- **`introduction_pages_generation.js`**: Functions to generate the pages for the introduction and tutorial phases.
- **`repo_cover.png`**: Repository image.
- **`message_to_participants.txt`**: Message to be sent to recruited participants.
- **`improvements.txt`**: Project improvements.

### Folders

- **`tutorial/`**: Files for introduction and tutorial phases.
- **`output_check/`**: Check of the output files.
- **`jspsych/`**: JSPsych libraries (some plugins are customized).
